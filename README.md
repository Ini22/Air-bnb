Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze an Airbnb dataset to gain insights into the availability, pricing, and review patterns of listings. Specifically, we subset the data to identify:

The first and last review dates for each listing.
The total number of private rooms available.
The mean price of all listings.
Key Analysis
First and Last Review Dates
We identify the earliest and latest dates that each listing was reviewed to analyze trends in review activity.

Number of Private Rooms
By counting the listings categorized as private rooms, we assess the availability of this room type across the dataset.

Mean Price of Listings
The mean price gives an overview of the average cost for Airbnb accommodations in the dataset.

Results
Summary of Findings:
Review Dates: The analysis reveals the range of active review periods for each listing, which can be used to understand how long listings have been on the market.
Private Rooms: A total of 11356 private rooms were identified in the dataset.
Mean Price: The average price across all listings is $141.78.
